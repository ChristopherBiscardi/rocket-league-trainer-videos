So you had this friend that went to this thing called RLCS and couldn't stop talking about some world record wave they did while watching some soccer cars. Eventually they annoyed you enought that you decided to check the game out to shut them up even though you prefer Fortnite anyway.

Or maybe you didn't hear it from anybody and saw it in a Steam sale or that weekend it was free on PlayStation decided to download it and couldn't convince any of your friends to play. That's cool too, welcome to the club.

In any case, you download the game, wait five years because your ISP decided now was a great time to go down, get your internet back, finish the download and boot the game up for the first time.

:game boot sequence with sound:

The music hits, you're feeling confident in your choices, and the cursor is already on "Play Game" so you jump in. There's a lot of game modes to choose from. Which do you pick? wait. How do I pick? Why can't I start a game?

# Let's talk game modes.

There are 4 casual games modes, 4 core competitive game modes, and 4 competitive extra games modes.

:show each pane when mentioning it:

Sometimes there's this random other game mode too but who knows when you're watching this so we'll just call it a mystery and move on.

:quickly point out the other tab; maybe include weird gameplay footage of random thing:
